# ANOMALOUS-HUMAN-ACTIVITY-DETECTION-USING-BI-LSTM
ABSTRACT:
Detecting anomalous human activities in video surveillance is a crucial task for ensuring security and safety in various environments. In this project, we propose an approach for anomalous human activity detection using a combination of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and MobileNet architectures. The proposed framework leverages the temporal dependencies captured by BiLSTM networks and the spatial features extracted by MobileNet convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to effectively detect anomalous activities in video sequences. First, we preprocess the input video frames and extract spatial features using a pre-trained MobileNet model. These features are then fed into a BiLSTM network, which learns the temporal dynamics of human activities over time. The BiLSTM network is trained to predict the next frame in the sequence based on the learned temporal context. During inference, the difference between the predicted and actual frames is calculated, and a thresholdbased anomaly score is computed to identify anomalous activities. We evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark datasets for anomalous activity detection in video surveillance, including Violent Flows datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of BiLSTM and MobileNet outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Our approach shows robustness to various types of anomalies, including abnormal behaviours and unusual interactions in crowded scenes. The proposed framework provides an effective solution for real-time anomalous human activity detection in video surveillance applications, with potential applications in security monitoring, crowd management, and public safety.

EXISTING SYSTEM:
Violent and non-violent activities were recognized using the presence of blood, degree of motion, and even characteristics of sound relating to violent activities. The surveillance cameras are not very effective in recording sounds related to certain activities. On the other hand, frame-based video analysis is solely based on a sequence of frames (that is, image) and not on audio. Violence can be categorized into many types, including one-to-one person violence, crowd violence, family violence, sports violence, violence with guns and many more. The crowd violence has been identified using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in. Different methods for violence detection proposed by researchers includes Motion Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (MoSIFT)[ Histogram of 
Gradients (HoG) + Histogram of optical Flow (HoF)] , Harris corner detection, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ConvLSTM networks (CNN+LSTMS) and weakly supervised semantic segmentation.
The concept of Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks was later introduced in the field of Natural Language Processing and gained popularity. We have implemented the model by combining the ideas of Bi-LSTM and Mobilenet to have better accuracy while predicting violent activity.

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY:
The proposed methodology for Anomalous Human Activity Detection combines the strengths of BiLSTM and Mobile Net techniques. Firstly, the Mobile Net architecture is 
utilized to efficiently extract spatial features from input video frames, leveraging its lightweight design tailored for mobile and embedded devices. These features serve as meaningful representations of human activities in the video data. Secondly, a BiLSTM network is employed to capture temporal dependencies and context across sequential frames, enabling the model to discern normal patterns of human behaviour from anomalies. By incorporating both spatial and temporal information, the BiLSTM-Mobile Net model achieves robust detection of anomalous human activities in video streams, making it suitable for real-time surveillance, security, and safety applications
